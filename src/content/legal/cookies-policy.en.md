# Cookie Policy

**Last Updated: January 15, 2025**
**Effective Date: January 15, 2025**

## Introduction

This Cookie Policy explains how Green Card Trips ("we," "us," or "our") uses cookies and similar technologies on our website at https://greencardtrips.com (the "Website").

We believe in transparency and your right to privacy. This policy will help you understand what cookies are, which ones we use (spoiler: very few), and how you can control them.

This Cookie Policy should be read together with our Privacy Policy, which explains how we handle your personal information.

## What Are Cookies?

Cookies are small text files that websites place on your device (computer, smartphone, or tablet) when you visit them. They help websites remember information about your visit, like your preferences or which pages you viewed.

Think of cookies like a bookmark - they help the website remember where you've been and what you've done, so your next visit can be more personalized and efficient.

### Types of Cookies

**First-party cookies** are set by the website you're visiting (in this case, greencardtrips.com).

**Third-party cookies** are set by someone other than the website owner - usually services that the website uses, like analytics tools.

Cookies can be **session cookies** (deleted when you close your browser) or **persistent cookies** (stay on your device for a set period or until you delete them).

## Cookies We Use

**We only use Google Analytics cookies to understand how visitors use our website.**

We do NOT use:
- Advertising cookies
- Social media tracking cookies
- Marketing cookies
- Profiling cookies
- Cookies that sell your data to third parties

Here are the specific cookies we use:

| Cookie Name | Provider | Purpose | Duration | Type |
|------------|----------|---------|----------|------|
| _ga | Google Analytics | Distinguishes unique visitors and calculates visitor, session, and campaign data | 2 years | Analytics |
| _ga_<container-id> | Google Analytics | Stores and counts pageviews | 2 years | Analytics |
| _gid | Google Analytics | Distinguishes unique visitors | 24 hours | Analytics |

That's it. These three cookies are the only ones we use.

## Why We Use Cookies

We use Google Analytics cookies to:

- **Understand website traffic**: See how many people visit our site and which pages they view
- **Improve user experience**: Identify which content is most helpful so we can create more of it
- **Support our community**: Learn what information green card holders need most on their path to citizenship
- **Fix problems**: Detect technical issues and broken links

We do NOT use cookies to:
- Track you across the internet
- Show you targeted advertisements
- Sell your information to third parties
- Build detailed profiles about you
- Follow you to other websites

Your privacy matters to us. Our mobile app stores all your trip data locally on your device, and we apply the same privacy-first approach to our website.

## Cookie Categories

### Strictly Necessary Cookies
**None.** Our website works perfectly fine without any cookies. We don't use cookies for essential website functionality.

### Analytics Cookies
**Google Analytics only.** These cookies help us understand how visitors use our website. They are optional - you can opt out and still use our website normally.

### Marketing/Advertising Cookies
**None.** We don't use any advertising or marketing cookies.

### Social Media Cookies
**None.** We don't embed social media tracking on our website.

## Your Cookie Choices

You are always in control of cookies. Here are your options:

### 1. Use Our Cookie Consent Banner

Depending on where you're located, you'll see a cookie consent banner when you first visit our website. You can:
- Accept all cookies
- Reject non-essential cookies (which means no Google Analytics)
- Customize your preferences

### 2. Browser Settings

You can control cookies through your web browser. Most browsers let you:
- Block all cookies
- Block third-party cookies only
- Delete existing cookies
- Be notified when websites set cookies

See the "How to Manage Cookies" section below for browser-specific instructions.

### 3. Google Analytics Opt-Out

You can opt out of Google Analytics specifically by:
- Installing the [Google Analytics Opt-out Browser Add-on](https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout)
- Using the settings in our cookie consent banner

**Important:** Blocking or deleting cookies won't affect your ability to use our website. All core functionality works without cookies.

## Geolocation-Based Consent

We respect privacy laws around the world and adjust our cookie consent process based on where you're located:

### European Union (EU) and European Economic Area (EEA)
If you're visiting from the EU/EEA, you'll see an opt-in consent banner. We won't set analytics cookies until you explicitly agree. This complies with the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) and ePrivacy Directive.

### California, USA
If you're visiting from California, you'll see a notice that includes information about your rights under the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA), including the right to opt out of data "sales" (though we don't sell your data).

### Other Locations
Visitors from other locations may see different notices based on their local privacy laws. We may use a less intrusive notice or an opt-out approach rather than opt-in.

### How Geolocation Works
We determine your approximate location based on your IP address. This detection happens on your device and is not stored or tracked. It's only used to show you the appropriate cookie consent banner.
