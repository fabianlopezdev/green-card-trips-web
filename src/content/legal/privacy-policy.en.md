# Privacy Policy

**Effective Date:** January 15, 2025
**Last Updated:** January 15, 2025

## Introduction

Green Card Trips ("we," "our," or "us") is committed to protecting your privacy. This Privacy Policy applies to our mobile application (the "App") available on iOS devices and our website at greencardtrips.com (the "Website").

We built Green Card Trips with privacy as a core principle. This policy explains our privacy-first approach and how we handle your information.

## Our Privacy-First Philosophy

**Your data belongs to you.** Green Card Trips is designed to keep your sensitive immigration information completely private and secure on your device. We do not collect, store, transmit, or have access to your personal data.

## Information Storage

### Mobile Application

The Green Card Trips mobile app stores all your information **exclusively on your device**. This includes:

- Your name and profile information
- Green Card issue date and residency status
- Trip history (departure dates, return dates, destinations, purposes)
- Travel calculations and eligibility estimates
- App preferences and settings

**Important:** This data is stored locally on your device. Your information never leaves your phone unless you explicitly choose to export it. We have no servers collecting your data, and no way to access your information.

### Website

Our website (greencardtrips.com) is a marketing and informational site. The only data stored by our website is:

- **Theme Preference:** We use browser localStorage to remember whether you prefer light or dark mode. This preference stays in your browser and is never transmitted to us.

## Website Analytics

### Google Analytics 4

We use Google Analytics 4 on our website to understand how visitors use our site and to improve your experience. This helps us see which pages are most helpful, what devices people use, and how we can make the site better for green card holders like you.

**What We Collect**

Google Analytics collects basic information about your website visit, including:
- Pages you view on our site
- How long you spend on each page
- Your device type (mobile, desktop, tablet)
- Your browser and operating system
- General geographic location (city/region level, not your exact location)
- How you arrived at our site (search engine, direct visit, etc.)

**Important:** This data is aggregated and anonymous. We do NOT collect personally identifiable information like your name, email, or green card details. We cannot identify individual visitors.

**Cookies Used**

Google Analytics uses the following cookies to collect this anonymous data:

- **_ga**: Distinguishes unique visitors (expires after 2 years)
- **_ga_<container-id>**: Stores and counts pageviews (expires after 2 years)
- **_gid**: Distinguishes unique visitors (expires after 24 hours)

These cookies contain random identifiers and do not store any personal information.

**Your Privacy Choices**

You can opt out of Google Analytics tracking in several ways:
- Use the [Google Analytics Opt-out Browser Add-on](https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout)
- Enable "Do Not Track" in your browser settings
- Use browser extensions that block analytics cookies
- Clear your cookies to reset your anonymous identifier

**Google's Privacy Practices**

- [How Google uses data when you use our partners' sites or apps](https://www.google.com/policies/privacy/partners/)

### Google Search Console

We use Google Search Console to understand how people find our website through search engines like Google. This tool helps us improve our search presence so green card holders can more easily find information about citizenship requirements.

**Important:** Google Search Console does NOT use cookies and does NOT track individual visitors. It only provides us with aggregated search data, such as:
- Which search terms led people to our site
- How often our site appears in search results
- Which pages get the most clicks from search

This data is completely anonymous and cannot be linked to any individual user.

## Information We Do NOT Collect

We want to be crystal clear about what we don't collect:

- ❌ No personal identifiable information (PII)
- ❌ No email addresses or account credentials
- ❌ No location tracking or GPS data
- ❌ No usage analytics or behavior tracking
- ❌ No advertising identifiers
- ❌ No device fingerprinting
- ❌ No IP addresses or browsing data
- ❌ No crash reports containing personal data
- ❌ No social media connections
- ❌ No third-party tracking pixels or cookies

## Third-Party Services

The Green Card Trips app does **not** integrate with any third-party services, analytics platforms, advertising networks, or social media platforms. Your data stays with you.

In the future, if we add optional features (such as cloud backup), we will update this policy and request your explicit consent before enabling any data transmission.

## Data Security

Your trip data and immigration information is sensitive, and we take its security seriously:

- **Biometric Protection:** You can optionally enable Face ID, Touch ID, or PIN protection to secure app access
- **No Transmission:** Since your data never leaves your device, it cannot be intercepted in transit
- **No Servers:** We don't operate servers that store user data, eliminating the risk of server breaches

## Your Rights and Control

Since all your data is stored locally on your device, you have complete control:

- **Access:** You can view all your data anytime within the app
- **Modification:** You can edit or update any information at any time
- **Deletion:** You can delete individual trips or clear all your data from the app's settings
- **Complete Removal:** Uninstalling the app permanently deletes all data from your device

## Children's Privacy

Green Card Trips is intended for use by Lawful Permanent Residents (green card holders) who are working toward U.S. citizenship. The app is not directed at children under 13, and we do not knowingly collect information from children.

## Changes to This Privacy Policy

We may update this Privacy Policy to reflect changes in our practices or for legal, operational, or regulatory reasons. If we make material changes, we will notify you through the app or our website. The "Last Updated" date at the top of this policy indicates when it was most recently revised.

Your continued use of Green Card Trips after changes are posted constitutes your acceptance of the updated Privacy Policy.

## International Users

Green Card Trips is designed for U.S. Permanent Residents. While the app can be used internationally, all data remains on your device regardless of your location. If you are located in the European Economic Area (EEA), United Kingdom, or other regions with data protection laws (such as GDPR), please note that we do not transfer your data to any servers, so international data transfer regulations do not apply.

## California Privacy Rights (CCPA)

If you are a California resident, you have specific rights under the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA). However, since we do not collect, sell, or share your personal information, these rights are satisfied by design:

- **Right to Know:** We don't collect your personal information
- **Right to Delete:** All data is stored locally on your device and can be deleted by you
- **Right to Opt-Out of Sale:** We don't sell personal information
- **Right to Non-Discrimination:** Not applicable as we don't collect data

## Contact Us

If you have any questions, concerns, or requests regarding this Privacy Policy or our privacy practices, please contact us:

**Email:** support@greencardtrips.com
**Website:** https://greencardtrips.com

We will respond to your inquiry within a reasonable timeframe.

## Legal Disclaimer

This app is an informational tool and does not provide legal advice. While we protect your privacy, you are responsible for ensuring the accuracy of the information you enter and for verifying your immigration eligibility with official USCIS sources or a qualified immigration attorney.

**Summary:** Green Card Trips is built with your privacy as the top priority. Your immigration data stays on your device, encrypted and secure. We don't collect, access, or share your information. You have complete control.
