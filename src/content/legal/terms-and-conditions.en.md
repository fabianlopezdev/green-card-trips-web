# Terms and Conditions

**Effective Date:** January 15, 2025
**Last Updated:** January 15, 2025

## Introduction

Welcome to Green Card Trips. These Terms and Conditions ("Terms") govern your use of the Green Card Trips mobile application (the "App") and our website at greencardtrips.com (the "Website"), collectively referred to as the "Service."

By downloading, installing, accessing, or using the Service, you agree to be bound by these Terms. If you do not agree to these Terms, please do not use the Service.

## About Green Card Trips

Green Card Trips is an informational tool designed to help U.S. Lawful Permanent Residents (green card holders) track their physical presence in the United States for naturalization eligibility purposes. The Service provides calculations and estimates based on publicly available USCIS rules and requirements.

## Important Legal Disclaimers

### Not Legal Advice

**THE SERVICE DOES NOT PROVIDE LEGAL ADVICE.** Green Card Trips is an informational tool only. The content, features, calculations, and information provided through the Service are for general informational and educational purposes only and do not constitute legal advice.

Immigration law is complex, subject to change, and varies based on individual circumstances. This tool cannot and does not replace the advice of a qualified immigration attorney who can evaluate your specific situation.

### No Attorney-Client Relationship

Your use of Green Card Trips does not create an attorney-client relationship between you and the creators of this Service. We are not a law firm and do not practice law.

### Not Affiliated with USCIS

Green Card Trips is an independent, third-party application and is **not affiliated with, endorsed by, or connected to** the U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS), the Department of Homeland Security (DHS), or any other government agency.

## Your Responsibilities

### Accuracy of Information

**YOU ARE SOLELY RESPONSIBLE** for the accuracy and completeness of all information you enter into the Service, including but not limited to:

- Your green card issue date ("Resident Since" date)
- Trip departure and return dates
- Eligibility path (3-year or 5-year rule)
- All other profile and travel information

**Inaccurate data will produce inaccurate results.** Always verify that your input data is correct.

### Verification with Official Sources

You must verify all eligibility calculations, dates, and recommendations with:

1. **Official USCIS sources** - Including the USCIS website, official forms, and guidance documents
2. **A qualified immigration attorney** - Who can provide personalized legal advice based on your specific circumstances
3. **Your actual immigration records** - Including your green card, passport stamps, and travel documents

The calculations provided by Green Card Trips are estimates based on the data you provide and publicly available rules. They may not account for all nuances of your individual situation.

You agree to use the Service only for lawful purposes and in accordance with these Terms. You agree not to:

- Use the Service for any illegal or fraudulent purpose

## Disclaimers and Limitations of Liability

### Immigration Law Changes

Immigration laws, policies, and USCIS interpretations change frequently. Green Card Trips may not reflect the most current legal requirements or policy updates. You must verify current requirements with USCIS or an immigration attorney.

### Calculation Limitations

While we strive for accuracy, the Service's calculations and estimates:

- Are based on general USCIS rules and may not account for exceptions or special circumstances
- Depend entirely on the accuracy of the data you provide
- May not reflect recent changes in immigration law or policy
- Cannot predict how USCIS will interpret or apply rules to your specific case
- Do not guarantee approval of your naturalization application

### Limitation of Liability

TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, GREEN CARD TRIPS AND ITS DEVELOPERS, OFFICERS, DIRECTORS, EMPLOYEES, AND AGENTS SHALL NOT BE LIABLE FOR:

**EVEN IF WE HAVE BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.**

IN JURISDICTIONS THAT DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OR LIMITATION OF LIABILITY FOR CONSEQUENTIAL OR INCIDENTAL DAMAGES, OUR LIABILITY IS LIMITED TO THE GREATEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW.

Because Green Card Trips is a free or low-cost tool provided as-is, in no event shall our total liability to you for all damages, losses, and causes of action exceed the amount you paid to use the Service (if any), or $10.00 USD, whichever is greater.
