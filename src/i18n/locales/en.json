    "title": "Common Questions About Travel, Continuous Residence, and Protecting Your Green Card",
    "q1": {
      "question": "What is Green Card Trips?",
      "answer": "Green Card Trips is an app that helps U.S. permanent residents track trips abroad, calculate physical presence, and understand how travel affects continuous residence and citizenship eligibility."
    },
    "q2": {
      "question": "How accurate are the calculations?",
      "answer": "Calculations follow USCIS rules. Departure and return days count as presence in the U.S. The app calculates both continuous residence (single trips over 180 or 365 days) and physical presence (total days abroad vs. required 548 or 913 days in the U.S.)."
    },
    "q3": {
      "question": "What is the 90-day early filing rule?",
      "answer": "USCIS allows certain applicants to file Form N-400 up to 90 days before meeting the continuous residence requirement. Green Card Trips calculates your earliest possible filing date and shows when you enter that 90-day window so you know when you can confidently submit your application."
    },
    "q4": {
      "question": "Is my data private and secure?",
      "answer": "Yes. All travel data is stored on your device and never shared. You have full control over backups and sync options."
    },
    "q5": {
      "question": "Can I use it offline?",
      "answer": "Absolutely. You can log trips and check your calculations without any internet connection."
    },
    "q6": {
      "question": "Is the app available on Android?",
      "answer": "Currently, Green Card Trips is available for iOS. Android support is coming soon."
    },
    "q7": {
      "question": "Can I lose my Green Card if I travel too long?",
      "answer": "Spending too much time outside the U.S. can make USCIS question whether you've abandoned your permanent residence. Trips over 180 days may raise concerns, and over 365 days almost always require proof you still live in the U.S. Green Card Trips helps you see this risk early by flagging long trips and showing how they affect your total time abroad — so you can plan reentry and protect your status with confidence."
    },
    "q8": {
      "question": "What is 'abandonment of residence'?",
      "answer": "Abandonment of residence happens when a permanent resident stays abroad so long — or so often — that it seems their main home is no longer in the U.S. Green Card Trips keeps your travel record clear and your days counted, helping you spot when your absences might raise questions and giving you the knowledge to act before issues arise."
    },
    "q9": {
      "question": "Do I need a reentry permit (Form I-131)?",
      "answer": "If you expect to be outside the U.S. for close to or more than a year, a reentry permit (Form I-131) can show you didn't intend to abandon your residence. Green Card Trips helps by warning you when a planned trip might be long enough to require one, giving you time to apply before you leave and avoid future complications."
    },
    "q10": {
      "question": "How many days can I stay abroad without losing my Green Card?",
      "answer": "There's no single magic number, but USCIS pays attention to absences over 180 days and especially over 365 days. The app helps you stay well within safe limits by tracking every trip and showing how your time abroad affects both continuous residence and physical presence — so you're always in control and never caught off guard."
